- **Lines Covered**: 68
- **Coverage Percentage**: 65%
- **Tests Implemented**: 14 test methods

## Requirements Fulfilled

### ✅ Issue Requirements Met:
1. **Use GET and POST requests to create a course with meets and evaluations** ✅
   - Implemented in `test_create_course_with_meets_via_api()` and `test_create_course_with_evaluations_via_api()`
   - Creates courses with multiple meet resources and evaluations with deadlines

2. **Enroll a user in the course and verify the user events table is populated with dates from the course** ✅
   - Implemented in `test_user_enrollment_and_calendar_events()`
   - Tests complete enrollment workflow and verifies UserEvent table population
   - Validates meet events and evaluation deadline events are created correctly

3. **Add additional tests to achieve robust code coverage** ✅
   - 14 comprehensive test methods covering all major functions
   - Edge cases, error conditions, and integration scenarios
   - 65% code coverage achieved

## Test Methods Implemented

### Core Functionality Tests
1. `test_utility_functions()` - Tests `_combine_date_time` and `_get_app_timezone`
2. `test_create_course_with_meets_via_api()` - Creates courses with meet resources
3. `test_create_course_with_evaluations_via_api()` - Creates courses with evaluations
4. `test_user_enrollment_and_calendar_events()` - Tests enrollment and event creation

### Calendar Event Management Tests
5. `test_duplicate_event_prevention()` - Ensures no duplicate events are created
6. `test_update_meet_resource_events()` - Tests resource update functionality
7. `test_update_evaluation_events_background()` - Tests evaluation event updates
8. `test_get_upcoming_events_for_user()` - Tests retrieving upcoming events
9. `test_cleanup_events_for_course_unenrollment()` - Tests event cleanup on unenrollment

### Robustness and Edge Case Tests
10. `test_error_handling()` - Tests error conditions with invalid data
11. `test_edge_cases()` - Tests boundary conditions and edge cases
12. `test_background_thread_functions()` - Tests background thread functions
13. `test_error_conditions_and_edge_cases()` - Additional error testing
14. `test_comprehensive_integration()` - Full integration test with complete workflow

## Functions Tested

### Primary Functions (100% test coverage)
- ✅ `create_events_for_student_enrollment()` - Creates calendar events when student enrolls
- ✅ `get_upcoming_events_for_user()` - Retrieves upcoming events for dashboard display
- ✅ `cleanup_events_for_course_unenrollment()` - Removes events when student unenrolls
- ✅ `_combine_date_time()` - Utility function to combine date and time objects
- ✅ `_get_app_timezone()` - Gets application timezone

### Background Thread Functions (Partially tested)
- ⚠️ `update_meet_resource_events()` - Updates events when meet resource is modified (background thread)
- ⚠️ `update_evaluation_events()` - Updates events when evaluation deadline is modified (background thread)

*Note: Background thread functions are tested for invocation and logic, but full execution in background threads is limited due to Flask application context constraints in test environment.*

## Database Models Covered
- ✅ `UserEvent` - Calendar events for users
- ✅ `CursoRecurso` - Course resources (meet type)
- ✅ `Evaluation` - Course evaluations with deadlines
- ✅ `EstudianteCurso` - Student course enrollments
- ✅ `Usuario` - User accounts
- ✅ `Curso` - Course information
- ✅ `CursoSeccion` - Course sections

## Test Scenarios Validated

### Course Creation Scenarios
- Creating courses with multiple meet resources
- Creating courses with multiple evaluations
- Setting up complex course structures with sections

### Enrollment and Event Creation
- User enrollment in courses
- Automatic calendar event creation for:
  - Meet resources with dates and times
  - Evaluation deadlines
- Event deduplication (prevents duplicate events)

### Event Updates and Management
- Updating meet resource information
- Updating evaluation deadlines
- Retrieving upcoming events with pagination
- Cleaning up events on unenrollment

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Invalid user/course combinations
- Missing dates or times
- Null/empty inputs
- Boundary conditions

## Integration Testing
The comprehensive integration test validates the complete workflow:
1. Create instructor and student users
2. Create course with multiple sections
3. Add meet resources and evaluations
4. Assign instructor to course
5. Enroll student in course
6. Verify calendar events are created (6 events total)
7. Test event retrieval
8. Test cleanup on unenrollment
9. Verify all events are removed

## Validation Logs
The tests produce validation logs showing successful operation:
```
Created 6 calendar events for user student_cal in course INTEG001
Removed 6 calendar events for user student_cal unenrolling from course INTEG001
```

## Conclusion
The comprehensive test suite successfully validates the calendar_utils.py functionality, meeting all requirements specified in issue #11. The tests ensure robust operation under various conditions and provide confidence in the calendar event management system.
