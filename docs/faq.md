With the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools, universities and other study centers had to use remote teaching as a tool to provide continuity to the teaching process.

However, at least as we lived that experience in Nicaragua, many study centers were not prepared to move to a remote teaching methodology and began to improvise with WhatsApp groups, Google Classroom, Edmodo and similar, in a large number of cases the experience was not good.

NOW - LMS arises as a project to offer a learning experience similar to what can be found in teaching environments such as Thinkific and Teachable, but without the hosting cost that these platforms charge and leaving open the option that educational institutions can charge for the courses they offer.

We hope that a situation like the COVID-19 pandemic will not happen again, but we can learn from past experiences so we can improve.

We hope that NOW - LMS is useful to you.
