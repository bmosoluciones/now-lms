## Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in the NOW-LMS project!

### Implemented Software Stack

- **Backend:** Python with Flask microframework  
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 with Alpine.js  
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy

### Dependencies

- Requires **Python >= 3.11**

### Quick Start

To start a local server, simply execute:

```bash
# Python >= 3.11
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install now_lms
venv/bin/lmsctl database init
venv/bin/lmsctl serve
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.
The default admin credentials are:

```
User: lms-admin
Password: lms-admin
```

For production deployments, see the [user manual](https://bmosoluciones.github.io/now-lms/setup.html).

Never use the default admin user and password in an Internet-accessible environment. It is recommended not to use easily guessable administrator usernames such as admin, root, or administrator.
Choosing a custom admin username makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your platform.
